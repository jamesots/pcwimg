pcwimg
======

Converts a 360x256 PNG image into a file suitable for displaying
quickly on an Amstrad PCW. It is stored in the file exactly as it
should be stored in the PCW's screen memory - so long as the Roller
RAM has been reset (i.e. each character row follows on from the
previous one). The image will have three colour levels: black, dark
green, green (or white on some PCWs)
